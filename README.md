# llncsconf

LaTeX package extending Springer's llncs class.

## Installation

Copy `llncsconf.sty` in a directory that is searched by LaTeX
(e.g,. either your `texmf` tree or the local directory with your main
LaTeX file.

## Usage

In a LaTeX file that uses Springer's `llncs` class, just add

```tex
    \usepackage{llncsconf}
```

to use the style.

The package supports the following general options:

* `crop`: crops the page (PDF) to the page size (152x235mm) used by
  the LNCS proceedings books (and the official PDFs offered by
  Springer). Please ensure that you *do not* have the option
  `a4paper` activated. Otherwise, cropping produces wrong results.
* `rcsinfo`: adds RCS revision information to the first page of
  the document.
* `svninfo`: adds subversion/svn revision information to the
  first page of the document.

To indicate the state of the paper, the package supports following choices:

* `intended`: adds a *submitted to ... please to no distribute* note
  to the first page.
* `submitted`: adds a *submitted to ... please to no distribute* note
  to the first page.
* `accepted`: adds a *accepted for publication at ...* note
  to the first page. This is useful for the phase where the camera
  ready version is prepared, but the publisher did not yet publish it.
* `proceedings`: typesets a note in which proceedings the paper was
  published (similar to `llncs` without Springer's availability note).
* `llncs`: typesets a copy of Springer's copyright note. This should
  satisfy Springer's requirements for self-archiving.
  You need to supply the DOI using `\llncsdoi{DOI}`.

To display the state information properly, additional commands are required:

* `\conference{name of the conference}` which takes one argument,
  i.e., the name of the conference. This is used when one of the
  options `intended`, `submitted`, or `accepted` is used for loading
  the package.
* `\llncs{book editors and title}{start page}` which takes two
  arguments: first the information about the book (e.g., editors,
  title) and, second, the start page of the chapter (contribution).
* `\llncsdoi{DOI}` which takes one argument,
  i.e., the DOI of the final publication available at Springer's web site.

| State | `\conference` | `\llncs` | `\llncsdoi` |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| intended | yes | no | no |
| submitted | yes | no | no |
| accepted | yes | no | no |
| proceedings | no | yes | no |
| llncs | no | yes | yes |

## Self-Archiving

Sprinter states in his [Springer's Consent to Publish v3](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/15433008/data/Contract_Book_Contributor_Consent_to_Publish_LNCS_SIPAut):

> Author may only post his/her own version, provided acknowledgment is given 
> to the original source of publication and a link is inserted to the published
> article on Springerâ€™s website. The link must be provided by inserting the DOI
> number of the article in the following sentence:
> "The final publication is available at Springer via 
> `http://dx.doi.org/[insert DOI]`".
The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) can be found at the bottom of the first page
of the published paper.

This package uses `https://doi.org` as `http://dx.doi.org` 
[is deprecated](https://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html).
